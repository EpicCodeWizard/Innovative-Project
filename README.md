# What is our project?
Our project is a food price calculator that takes a prediction of the future Consumer Price Index (an increase in prices starting from the 1930s-60s to the present) and calculates the price of items today using the average cost of different items per pound.

# Who are we?
We are a group of teens who wish to help the people of the world through these hard times, when COVID-19 and the worldwide economic recession are rampant.

# How does this help people today?
Our food price calculator aids users in budgeting their purchases of edible items, particularly at a time when inflation is uncertain and may go either higher or lower. This can potentially result in thousands of households struggling across the nation, especially when poverty is at an all-time high.

# How did we create this website?
Using datasets of price increase percentages of different categories of food provided by the US government, we created the web application using these tools:
- Frontend
    - HTML/CSS/JS 
- Backend
    - Flask (Python)
- Machine Learning Models (for the data)
    - Scikit-learn and Pandas (Python)
